### Mobile App Architecture
- **React Native** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Expo framework** for cross-platform development
- **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence
- **Hooks-based state management** with React hooks
- **Component-based architecture** for reusability
- **Error boundaries** and proper error handling

### Data Flow
1. **Local-first approach** - data stored locally for offline capability
2. **API synchronization** - automatic sync when user is authenticated
3. **Conflict resolution** - local data takes precedence
4. **Real-time updates** - immediate UI updates with background sync

## 📱 **How to Test Advanced Features**

### 1. **Authentication Testing**
```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Login with existing user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo@example.com", "password": "password"}'
```

### 2. **Device Features Testing**
- **Location**: Grant location permission when prompted
- **Accelerometer**: Move device to see real-time motion data
- **Notifications**: Allow notification permissions for alerts

### 3. **Reviews System Testing**
- Complete a task by tapping the checkbox
- Tap the star (⭐) button to open review modal
- Rate the task and add optional comments
- Submit review to see it in the system

### 4. **Analytics Testing**
- Open and close the app multiple times
- Create and complete various tasks
- Check analytics data in AsyncStorage
